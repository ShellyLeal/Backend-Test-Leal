# Backend-Test-Leal
Implementation of a management system to coordinate the meal delivery for Cornershop employees.

Trello Updates on the project steps (please be free to read about the step Future Implementations and colaborate): https://trello.com/b/u1iDFoU7/meal-management


# Preparing the Django environment
To clone the project, use the following command:

Please create a virtual environment before working on the project. Here are the instructions for doing so: https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/venv.html


# Preparing the Slack environment

You will need to create a Slack group for receiving the restaurant's update about the daily menu.


After creating the group and the proper channel, you need to create a Slack API. Here are the instructions for doing so: https://api.slack.com/apps

After that, register the authentication code for the app. Here are the instructions for doing so: https://api.slack.com/legacy/oauth

With the channel name and the OAuth Code, change the following fields in the file settings.py of this project.

    # The Slack app token - can be generated by Slack API 
    OAUTH_TOKEN = 'xoxb-1591136001063-1591149264087-GpKJA7IfXsQrlcRIhJtPT7Dx' 

    # The Slack channel name
    SLACK_CHANNEL = '#restaurante'


To test administrator tools (the restaurant owner), feel free to clone the project and use the following command:

    python manage.py createsuperuser

For deleting the superuser, use the following commands inside the virtual environment:
    
    python manage.py shell
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    User.objects.get(username="NameHere", is_superuser=True).delete()
  
But remember, I recommended you to create users inside the testing environment, which can be done by using the available Unit Tests by the end of this tutorial.

There are two mock members to represent the clients of the restaurant. Here are their following IDs and passwords:

      # Company Worker called Justin
      justin
      user12345
      # Company Worker called Sarah
      sarah
      sarah123


# Unit Testing Instructions
You can run the tests with the following command: 

    python manage.py test
    
The ideal is to get the following results, if the tests results are positive:
